# Center of Mass, read from an Image, Computer

Computes the center of mass of a black and white image. Select an image and the center of mass of the white portion of the image will be computed.

It can either be used as a library or it can be ran, in which case it will use a file picker to read the image and will output the coordinates of the center of mass in a dialog.
